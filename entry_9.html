          I would split front-end and back-end into two separate classes. As someone who struggled to understand topics as we entered the back-end side of web development, I think future generations would appreciate this. Regardless of the class delivery method whether it be online or in-person, I would keep the layout of lectures outside of class time and labs during class time since I believe you learn things better by doing them versus just watching someone else do it and not trying it out yourself. Initially, I didn't enjoy being thrown into random groups every class for labs, but I quickly realized that it would be better to get used to it since doing so better simulates the real world.

          It's a bit difficult to say what I think would help students learn because everyone's case will be a bit different and it depends on the subject. For me, the front-end topics were much easier to understand relative to the back-end topics. I was comfortable learning new bits of information regarding the front-end ideas every class because I was able to keep up, but I immediately fell behind as soon as back-end ideas were introduced and had to take Thanksgiving break to catch up. Even now I'm not sure if I understand everything to an adequate level. I would say that I started to feel like I understood how React worked while implementing project 2, so I learned by doing.

          For labs this semester, it was good that we were split into random groups, but it seemed like each group was at a completely different level in terms of understanding the lab's content. Some groups would finish, while others wouldn't. I'm not really sure how I would fix this, even though I initially thought of doing a lab as a class where the instructor would ask questions along the way to guage understanding. I think the problem with this is that people would be too shy to ask questions or answer in front of the entire class, but I'll just throw that out as an idea. All of this is assuming it was kind of a pain when you had to jump between breakout rooms and explain concepts that you've just told the previous breakout room.

          This was the CS course that I was the most excited to take since I got into the CS program and it did not dissapoint. I wasn't sure what to expect since you replaced Dr. Stewart this semester, but I'm very glad you were the instructor. Your understanding of upperclassmen stresses demonstrated through flexible deadlines was extremely thoughtful and I appreciated it very much. I wish you came to JMU sooner in my undergraduate career. I would've signed up for and taken all your classes without a moment's hesitation if I hadn't taken them already / wasn't about to graduate.
