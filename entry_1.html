    <h2>Semantic Structure</h2>

    <p>
      HTML has semantic structure, where the tags clearly define the content. One reason to have semantic structure is because search engines need to break down HTML to understand it and be able place it in search results. The header usually displays some introductory content possibly with a banner or other image. The nav section has navigation links to other sites or other sections within the same page. Main includes headings for introductory content, sections to group similar content, and articles for self-contained content. Lastly, the footer contains copyright information, contact information, or related documents.

    <h2>Head Elements</h2>

    <p>
      The head tag contains metadata, which is data about data, such as character sets, titles, styles, etc. Specifically, it contains data about the HTML page. The title tag declares the text that appears in the tab bar. The link tag connects a document to an external source which can be used to show photos or link an external style sheet. The style tag defines style information to change the appearance on the document. The script tag allows you to type Javascript code inside the html file similar to how the style tag allows you to type CSS. These are a few of many tags that can be included in the head tag.
