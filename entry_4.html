        <p>
          It's important to design webpages to follow people's natural reading behavior. Many studies have shown that people scan computer screens in an "F" pattern. People rarely look at the right side of a page because their eyes tend to begin scanning at the top left area. This idea is illustrated below.

        </div>
        <p>
          Our eyes usually follow this pattern. First, they read headlines on the top, then read down the left side for possible navigation or bigger ideas in bullet points, and lastly across the middle of the page looking out for bolded words or subheadlines. Interestingly, in a study that used an eye-tracker to see what the user was seeing, this heat map was produced. Red means highly viewed, yellow means some views, blue means least viewed, and gray means next to no views.

          Since this is an aspect/idea of effective web design there isn't really any code to show for this. ðŸ˜”
