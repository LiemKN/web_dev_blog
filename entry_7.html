                    React JS is a Javascript library used to build interactive elements on websites. A Javascript
                    library is a collection of pre-written Javascript code that can used for common JS tasks. Because
                    many webpages have repetitive functions such as animation effects or autocomplete, the programmer
                    can use the respective libraries to fulfill the desired function without needing to rewrite these tasks. React
                    JS is for front-end development AKA client side devleopment.

                    React makes use of JSX or Javascript eXtension which is a React extension that makes it easy for web
                    developers to modify DOMs (Document Object Model), a representational tree of how a web page is
                    arranged. This acts as the skeleton of the webpage the same way HTML does. The following is an
                    example of JSX.
                </p>
                <pre>
                return (
                    {colors.map(color => <Swatch key={color.name} color={color} remove={removeColor}/>)}
                );
                </pre>
                <p>
                    React also uses virtual DOMs which is a copy of a site's DOM that React uses to determine the parts of the page were actually changed. This prevents unnecessary entire page reloads which is extremely inefficient.
