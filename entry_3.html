          Color has an important impact on how a webpage is viewed. First, color can represent emotion and tone. The
          color's meaning can change based on various factors such as vibrancy, pairings, or location. Here are the
          meanings of some colors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Colors can be used to highlight important features or sections of a webpage, and generally make a webpage more
          aesthetically pleasing when used correctly. This can be seen very well in webpages using a minimal color
          palette.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most important aspects about choosing color for a webpage is contrast. Contrasting colors are
          colors that exist on opposite sides of a color wheel. This is especially important for ensuring text and
          graphics are readable by a user. Some color pairs can strain the user's eyes. However, choosing colors that
          are across from each other on the color wheel isn't always necessary. Take the picture as an example to
          illustrate some of these ideas.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="images/entry_3_contrast_example.png" alt="Good and Bad Contrast example">
        </div>
        <p>
          On the left side, even though red and green are on opposite sides of the color wheel which technically provide
          good contrast, the bright green text will strain the user's eyes because it is difficult to look at for long
          periods of time. The middle shows how two colors lacking contrast result in lack of visibility. The right side
          has little contrast between the background and text, but despite that fact, it is very easy to read and is
          easy on the eyes.
